Why it's impressive: It’s an empathetic feature for neurodivergent users and could set your platform apart as truly understanding of their needs.
Tech to implement: Front end with emoji pickers or color selectors, with backend storage for daily moods.

1. Mood Selection:

Users start by selecting a general mood (e.g., happy, anxious, confused, frustrated). This can be displayed visually, with icons or colors representing different emotional states.
2. Reflective Prompts (Optional): After selecting a mood, users are given the option to respond to a few guided prompts. These are designed to help them better understand or reflect on their emotional state. The user can skip these if they prefer.

Examples of Prompts:

What happened today that might have contributed to this mood?
Did a specific event, conversation, or environment affect how you're feeling?
Are your emotions influenced by something physical (tiredness, pain) or mental (thoughts, stress)?
Is this feeling familiar? Have you felt this way recently?
If your feeling were a color or shape, what would it look like? (Creative approach for users who struggle with verbalizing emotions.)
Is there something that could help you feel better or continue feeling good? (Encourages proactive thinking.)
3. Mood Spectrum/Descriptors:

To assist with precision, after selecting a general mood, users are shown a "Mood Spectrum" that offers more specific descriptions of the mood. This can help users pinpoint exactly what they're feeling.
Happy: content, joyful, energized, peaceful, fulfilled
Anxious: nervous, restless, uneasy, tense, overwhelmed
Confused: uncertain, lost, conflicted, unsure
Frustrated: irritated, annoyed, stuck, impatient
4. Mood Trends & Insights:

As users log their moods over time, the tracker can generate visual trends (graphs, charts) showing how their mood fluctuates across days, weeks, or months. The app might provide simple insights like:
"You often feel anxious in the evening."
"Happiness tends to follow days when you’ve interacted with your community."
"You've reported feeling frustrated more on workdays."
5. Private Reflection vs. Optional Sharing:

The system starts as private and reflective, so users can track their emotions without judgment or pressure. Later, the option to share with trusted friends or within specific groups could be added, allowing users to feel supported if they choose to open up.
Sharing could include: mood history, trends, or specific journal entries.
6. Integrating Fun and Accessibility:

To make the experience more engaging, users could use stickers, gifs, or mood-related visuals to represent how they feel. These can be designed to be friendly and fun but also compliant with accessibility principles (WCAG 2.2 standards), ensuring that people with physical impairments or who use screen readers can fully engage in the process.
Features like alternative text for images and clear, simple navigation for all users.
7. Notification or Check-In Feature:

Gentle, periodic check-ins asking how a user feels might help users get into the habit of reflecting on their mood without feeling pressured. These notifications can be tailored to the user’s preferences (e.g., daily, weekly).
"How are you feeling today? Have a moment to reflect?"


Why It’s Beneficial for ND Users:

Self-Awareness: Many ND individuals may find it helpful to visualize their emotional states over time. A tracking tool can provide insights into patterns, triggers, or even predictability in mood changes.
Coping Mechanisms: By recognizing patterns (e.g., certain times of the month or week where they feel more stressed), users can plan strategies for better self-care.
Empathy & Support: A visual tool that tracks emotional well-being can also promote empathy from friends, family, and the online community. For example, they could see when someone is having a rough patch and offer support.
Mental Health Awareness: This feature can align with broader efforts in mental health awareness, providing ND users with tools to help manage or better understand their emotions.

How It Benefits Your CV/Portfolio:

Data Visualization Skills: If you build charts or graphs that track mood trends, you’ll be demonstrating your ability to work with data visualizations, which is highly sought after in front-end development.
Advanced Front-End Techniques: This feature can include dynamic, real-time data updates, use of APIs, and interactive components, all of which are impressive for any developer.
Focus on Accessibility: Many employers today appreciate products that show a genuine focus on accessibility and inclusive design. A mood tracking tool would underscore your sensitivity to user needs, particularly for ND users.
Database Management: To track trends over time, you’ll need to store and manage data points—great experience with databases (both front-end local storage and back-end databases like MongoDB, Firebase, etc.).
User Engagement: Showing that you've built features that increase engagement and retention (e.g., mood tracking encourages regular visits) is valuable in demonstrating your understanding of user experience (UX) design.

How to Build It:

User Input: Use simple visual cues like emojis or a color-coded scale (from calm to stressed) for daily mood input.
Data Storage: Store these daily inputs in a database, possibly even adding tags or notes so users can describe what’s influencing their mood.
Trend Visualization: Use line graphs, bar charts, or even a calendar heatmap to show emotional trends over time.
Reminders: You could add reminders for users to input their mood daily or even let them set their own reminder schedule.
Privacy Considerations: Mood tracking can involve sensitive data, so make sure you give users control over whether they want their trends to be visible to others or just kept private.
Bonus: Integration Ideas
